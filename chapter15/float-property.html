            A lot of layouts place boxes
            next to each other. The float
            property is commonly used to
            achieve this.
        </p>
        <p>
            When elements are floated, the
            height of the boxes can affect
            where the following elements sit.
        </p>
        <p>
            In this example, you can see six
            paragraphs, each of which has a
            width and a float property set.
        </p>
        <p>
            The fourth paragraph does not
            go across to the left hand edge
            of the page as one might expect.
            Rather it sits right under the
            third paragraph.
        </p>
        <p>
            The reason for this is that the
            fourth paragraph has space to
            start under the third paragraph,
            but it cannot go any further to
            the left because the second
            paragraph is in the way.
        </p>
        <p>
            Setting the height of the
            paragraphs to be the same
            height as the tallest paragraph
            would solve this issue, but it
            is rarely suited to real world
            designs where the amount of
            text in a paragraph or column
            may vary. It is more common
            to use the clear property
            (discussed on the next page) to
            solve this issue.
